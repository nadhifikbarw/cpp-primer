# Pointer & Reference

Exercise 215-225 talk about pointer and references and i think it's better to skip the book for this part and watch this videos instead than do the exercises.

Pointer:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxHyVn0ODg

Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzoFn3dfsPA

# Const

Once again the book doesnt really talk a lot about this topic, use this reference instead:

It's recommended to just skip over the book, the many example is trivial.
