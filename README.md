# C++ Primer 5th ed. Exercises Answers

I decided to create this repository to give myself more accountability to actually finish this book and do its exercises, breaking bad habit of mine where I dont finish most of programming language books. This repository might be not suitable for publics since I intend to only write this answers for myself.

Better repository if you need answers: https://github.com/Mooophy/Cpp-Primer
