# Thoughts

This chapter is great to get started using C++ language to do standard basic programming. I was lazy to do some exercises in this chapter that's why some exercise only contains program that return 0 instead of me answering the trivial basic questions.

# Chapter Summary

This chapter introduced enough of C++ to let you compile and execute simple C++ programs. We saw how to define a main function, which is the function that the operating system calls to execute our program. We also saw how to define variables, how to do input and output, and how to write if, for, and while statements. The chapter closed by introducing the most fundamental facility in C++: the class. In this chapter, we saw how to create and use objects of a class that someone else has defined. Later chapters will show how to define our own classes.
