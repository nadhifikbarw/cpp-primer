	//  * But here's better answer:
	//  *
	//  * The main difference between the for's
	//  * and the while's is a matter of pragmatics:
	//  * awe usually use for when there is a known
	//  * number of iterations, and use while constructs when
	//  * the number of iterations in not known in advance.
	//  * The while vs do ... while issue is also of pragmatics,
	//  * the second executes the instructions once at start,
	//  * and afterwards it behaves just like the simple while.
